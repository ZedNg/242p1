### "Growing Circles"

The idea is to "grow" ellipses to show changes in the time. 

I wanted to give it a minimalist style to keep it clean and simple. In my original idea, I wanted to use only the colours to as a reference to the exact number on the clock, but the flashing clock is very irritating so that that part of the idea is scrapped. Thus, I added a "blob" on each ellipses and have them moved according to the movement of the hands on the traditional analog clock. When the clock is armed, a circle appears around the clock and it shrinks into the clock until the countdown(set to 20 seconds by default) reaches zero. 

In case of any difficulty on reading the clock, the time in HH:MM:SS format is shown in the center of the clock when the mouse cursor is close to the center. A text indicator of the alarm and the countdown is also shown when mouse is near the center and the alarm is armed.

The background changes colour with reference to the time period.

	-Blue 		> Noon 				> 11AM to 4PM
	-Pink 		> Dusk 				> 4PM to 8PM
	-Dark Blue 	> Late Night 		> 8PM to 12AM
